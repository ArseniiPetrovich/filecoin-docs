# The Filecoin project

### Roadmap

The [Filecoin Community Roadmap](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/456) is updated quarterly. It provides insight into the strategic development of the network and offers pathways for community members to learn more about ongoing work and connect directly with project teams.

### Research

Learn about the ongoing cryptography research and design efforts that underpin the Filecoin protocol on the [Filecoin Research website](https://github.com/filecoin-project/research). The [CryptoLab at Protocol Labs](https://research.protocol.ai/groups/cryptolab/) also actively researches improvements.

### Code of conduct

The Filecoin community believes that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting, and free from intimidation or harassment. To that end, we ask that everyone involved in Filecoin read and respect our [code of conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md).
